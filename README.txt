Usage
======================================================
-Open Unity Hub and click Open
-Select the repo
-Once the project opens, go to scenes and open Playground
-Select the ExampleCharacter and dig down in the scene hierarchy until you find the hand on the ExampleCharacter
-The mace that is a child of the hand contains a number of scriptable objects that the hand uses to animate the weapon and apply affects
-See console log for effects. 
(As this is just a use case example I did not extend the Unity standard character controller to take the parameters used to write the debug messages.)
